  <h2 id="about">About OKURA Masafumi</h2>

  <h3>As a software developer</h3>

  <p>I'm a software developer based in <strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>. My primary expertise is <strong>Ruby</strong> and <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>.</p>
  <p>I've been doing software development for over 10 years and been passionate.</p>
  <p>I've been involved mostly in early stage projects, but also interested in improving/fixing legacy codes/apps.</p>
  <p>I'm good at using tools such as RSpec and RuboCop with years of experiences.</p>
  <p>I like Ruby so much that I've created several gems. Please visit <a href="https://github.com/okuramasafumi" target="_blank">GitHub</a> if you're interested.</p>
  <p>My primary focus of development is now on <a href="https://github.com/okuramasafumi/alba" target="_blank">Alba</a>, a JSON serializer for Ruby. It features performance, usability and extensibility. If you're looking for a way to serialize objects into JSON with Ruby, you can try it out.</p>
  <p>I use <a href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank">Neovim</a> as my primary text editor and I love it (in fact, I talked about my Neovim usage to over 100 people in tech conference devoted to Vim!)</p>
  <p>If you'd like to know more about my development environment, please see my <a href="https://github.com/okuramasafumi/dotfiles" target="_blank">my dotfiles</a>.</p>

  <h3>As a public speaker</h3>
  <p>I was a speaker at <a href="https://rubyconf.org" target="_blank">RubyConf</a> 2021. In 2023 I gave a lightning talk at <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2023" target="_blank">RubyKaigi</a>, and gave talks at <a href="https://2023.euruko.org/">Euruko 2023</a> and <a href="https://2023.rubyconf.tw/">RubyConfTw2023</a>.</p>
  <p>In 2024, I gave a talk at <a href="https://reddotrubyconf.com/" target="_blank">Red Dot Ruby Conference 2024</a> about DSL.</p>
  <p>I also give talks in various meetups about many topics.</p>

  <h3>As a community/conference organizer</h3>
  <p>I'm organizing a few Ruby communities in Tokyo and online: <a href="https://growrb.doorkeeper.jp/" target="_blank">Grow.rb</a>, <a href="https://entakurb.doorkeeper.jp" target="_blank">Entaku.rb</a> and <a href="https://rubygems-code-reading.connpass.com/" target="_blank">Rubygems Code Reading Meetup</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm also a chief organizer of <a href="https://kaigionrails.org" target="_blank">Kaigi on Rails</a>, which started in 2020 as a new tech conference focusing on Web development.</p>
  <p>I also was one of the organizers of <a href="https://vimconf.org/2019/" target="_blank">VimConf 2019</a> which was successful.</p>

  <h3>Misc</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in Japan and I'm a native speaker of Japanese. "OKURA" is my family name and "Masafumi" is my given name: we have family name first and given name last.</p>
  <p>I practiced my English in Japan. My TOEIC score was 920 several years ago.</p>
  <p>I enjoy brewing coffee. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/okuramasafumi/" target="_blank">My Instagram account</a> lists my photos on coffee.</p>
